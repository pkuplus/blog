# Python dataclass 源码阅读

## 先来看看如何使用

```python
In [1]: class FooDataClass:
   ...:     def __init__(self, name, num=1):
   ...:         self.name = name
   ...:         self.num = num
   ...:         

In [2]: from dataclasses import dataclass

In [3]: @dataclass
   ...: class BarDataClass:
   ...:     name: str
   ...:     num: int = 1
   ...:     

In [4]: FooDataClass("jhon")
Out[4]: <__main__.FooDataClass at 0x7f1fe26964a8>

In [5]: BarDataClass("jhon")
Out[5]: BarDataClass(name='jhon', num=1)

```

没有dataclass之前，主要都是如1中使用，或者是使用namedtuple，但是现在有了dataclass就方便了。但是这玩意儿强制使用type signature。

## 源码阅读

当然，宇宙惯例，直接去看 `dataclass` 装饰器怎么实现的。

```python
def dataclass(_cls=None, *, init=True, repr=True, eq=True, order=False,
              unsafe_hash=False, frozen=False):
    """Returns the same class as was passed in, with dunder methods
    added based on the fields defined in the class.

    Examines PEP 526 __annotations__ to determine fields.

    If init is true, an __init__() method is added to the class. If
    repr is true, a __repr__() method is added. If order is true, rich
    comparison dunder methods are added. If unsafe_hash is true, a
    __hash__() method function is added. If frozen is true, fields may
    not be assigned to after instance creation.
    """

    def wrap(cls):
        return _process_class(cls, init, repr, eq, order, unsafe_hash, frozen)

    # See if we're being called as @dataclass or @dataclass().
    if _cls is None:
        # We're called with parens.
        return wrap

    # We're called as @dataclass without parens.
    return wrap(_cls)
```

按照我们上面的例子，那就是调用了 `_process_class`，所以我们继续进去看：

```python
def _process_class(cls, init, repr, eq, order, unsafe_hash, frozen):
    # Now that dicts retain insertion order, there's no reason to use
    # an ordered dict.  I am leveraging that ordering here, because
    # derived class fields overwrite base class fields, but the order
    # is defined by the base class, which is found first.
    fields = {}

    setattr(cls, _PARAMS, _DataclassParams(init, repr, eq, order,
                                           unsafe_hash, frozen))

    # Find our base classes in reverse MRO order, and exclude
    # ourselves.  In reversed order so that more derived classes
    # override earlier field definitions in base classes.  As long as
    # we're iterating over them, see if any are frozen.
    any_frozen_base = False
    has_dataclass_bases = False
    for b in cls.__mro__[-1:0:-1]:

            if getattr(b, _PARAMS).frozen:
                any_frozen_base = True

    # Annotations that are defined in this class (not in base
    # classes).  If __annotations__ isn't present, then this class
    # adds no new annotations.  We use this to compute fields that are
    # added by this class.
    #
    # Fields are found from cls_annotations, which is guaranteed to be
    # ordered.  Default values are from class attributes, if a field
    # has a default.  If the default value is a Field(), then it

    if not getattr(cls, '__doc__'):

        cls.__doc__ = (cls.__name__ +
                       str(inspect.signature(cls)).replace(' -> None', ''))

    return cls
```

看到 `if init` 那里，就很明显了，调用了 `_set_new_attribute`，那我们继续进去看：

```python
def _set_new_attribute(cls, name, value):
    # Never overwrites an existing attribute.  Returns True if the
    # attribute already exists.
    if name in cls.__dict__:
        return True
    setattr(cls, name, value)
    return False
```

而 `_init_fn` 做的事情就是初始化了。

实现的细节比较繁杂，但是原理还是挺简单的。这篇源码分析就到这了。
